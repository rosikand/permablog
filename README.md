Sometimes I change the layout and design of my website and/or blog which often alters the URL of some blog posts. To (somewhat) counteract this shortcoming of my workflow, I am creating this repo which will contain an archive of all my blog posts, viewable on the web at [https://rosikand.github.io/permablog](https://rosikand.github.io/permablog). a "permablog"! 


**Note**: the post layout is powered by [markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) and the blogroll style and HTML is adapted from [Colin Raffel's blog](https://colinraffel.com/blog/).
