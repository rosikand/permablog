Hello, this is a template file! Welcome to Markdeep. It's the simple way to write plain text with
_style_. From https://casual-effects.com/markdeep.


# Introduction  

This is a template post! 

Don't take it too seriously. Read at your own risk! 


## Subsection

Hey! Hi! Yo! 

## Thoughts

- Another way I thought about making this site was to render the markdown files using pandoc and/or author them using Quarto. This creates additional file dependencies in directory but does not rely on external links like Markdeep does.
